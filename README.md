# SCT_DS_4

# DESCRIPTION 
This repository contains Task 04 of the SkillCraft Technology internship, which focuses on analyzing traffic accident data to uncover patterns and insights. The goal of this task is to understand how factors such as road conditions, weather, and time of day influence the likelihood and severity of accidents, and to identify accident hotspots.

# Objectives

Perform data cleaning to handle missing or inconsistent accident records.

Explore accident data to detect trends and correlations.

Identify how road surface, lighting, and weather conditions contribute to accidents.

Examine the impact of time of day, day of the week, and seasonal effects.

Visualize accident hotspots using geographical data (if available).

Highlight key contributing factors to road accidents.

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. Accident Frequency
Total number of accidents recorded in the dataset.
Accident count per day/week/month.

2. Time-Based Accident Trends
Percentage of accidents by time of day (morning, afternoon, evening, night).
Peak accident hours.

3. Weather Condition Impact
Number/percentage of accidents under clear, rainy, foggy, snowy weather.
Accident severity distribution across weather conditions.

4. Road Condition Impact
Accident counts by road surface type (dry, wet, icy, damaged).
Correlation between poor road conditions and accident severity.

5. Location & Hotspot Analysis
Top accident-prone areas or regions.
Accident density (heatmap) per location.

6. Severity & Casualties
Percentage of accidents by severity levels (minor, serious, fatal).
Average number of casualties per accident.

7. Contributing Factors
Leading causes of accidents (e.g., speeding, distracted driving, weather, road condition).
Factor-wise distribution of accidents.

# Task Insights
In this task, I built a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The analysis was performed using the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Key Steps

1. Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values and categorical encoding.
Normalized and prepared features for model training.

2. Model Building
Implemented a Decision Tree Classifier.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

3. Model Evaluation
Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Used confusion matrix to visualize classification results.

4. Insights Extracted
Certain features such as age, job type, marital status, and previous campaign outcomes had a strong impact on predicting whether a customer subscribes.
Decision Tree helps in identifying rules and conditions that influence customer purchase behavior.

# Final Conclusion

In this task, I built a Decision Tree Classifier using the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The objective was to predict whether a customer would subscribe to a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral attributes.

üîç Key Outcomes

Performed data preprocessing: handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and normalized data where required.

Built and trained a Decision Tree model to classify customer responses.

Evaluated performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualized the decision tree to understand key decision rules influencing predictions.


üìä Insights

Contact type (cellular/telephone), duration of last contact, and previous campaign outcomes were strong predictors of customer subscription.

Socio-demographic factors such as age, job type, and marital status also impacted purchasing behavior.

The model helps in identifying potential customers, thereby improving targeted marketing strategies.


## This task demonstrated the application of supervised machine learning for classification problems, showcasing how decision trees can be used to derive actionable insights and support data-driven business decisions.
